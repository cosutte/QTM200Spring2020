# Problem 1
#####################

#A private school counselor was curious about the average of IQ of the students iin her school and took a random sample of 25 students' IQ scores. 
#The following is the data set:

y <- c(105, 69, 86, 100, 82, 111, 104, 110, 87, 108, 87, 90, 94, 113, 112, 98, 80, 97, 95, 111, 114, 89, 95, 126, 98)

#find a 90% confidence interval for the student IQ in the school assuming the population of IQ from which our random sample has been selected is normally distributed.

sd(y) #13.09
qnorm(.95) #1.64
mean(y) #98.44

me <- 1.64*(13.09/sqrt(10))
me #6.78

mean(y)-me #91.65
mean(y)+me #105.22

#90% CI = (91.65, 105.22)

# Problem 2

# A private school counselor was curious whether the average IQ of the students in her school is higher than the average IQ score 100 among all the schools in the country. 
#She took a random sanple of 25 students. The following is the data set. 

y <- c(105, 69, 86, 100, 82, 111, 104, 110, 87, 108, 87, 90, 94, 113, 112, 98, 80, 97, 95, 111, 114, 89, 95, 126, 98)

#conduct a test with 0.05 significance level assuming the population of IQ from which our random sample has been selected is normally distributed.

#data fits the assumptions of random sampling, quantitative data, and normal distribution
#state hypotheses: H0 = 100 , HA does not = 100

#calculate a test statistic
mean(y) #sample mean = 98.44
#population mean = 100
sd(y) #sd of sample = 13.09
13.09/sqrt(25) #standard deviation of sampling distribution = 2.618

(98.44-100)/2.618 #-0.5958747, df=24

#find p value
2*pt(abs(-0.59), df=24, lower.tail=F)
#p=value = 0.56

#Since p < Î±, we conclude that the evidence supports the null hypothesis. 
#The average IQ of the students in her school is not higher than the average IQ score 100 among all the schools in the country.

# Problem 3

#Researchers are curious about what affects the education expenditure on public education.
#expenditure is the available variables in a data set about the education expenditure. 

expenditure.txt
expenditure <- read.table("expenditure.txt", header=T)

#Please plot the reltionships among Y, X1, X2, and X3.
#Plot Y
expenditure$Y
hist(expenditure$Y, main="Per Capita Expenditure on Public Education", xlab="Y", ylab="Frequency")

#The data for Y presents a bimodal histogram, with two spikes. The first at around 60 and the second at 100. 


#Plot X1
hist(expenditure$X1, main="Per Capita Personal Income", xlab="X1", ylab="Frequency")
#X1 displays a relatively normal distribution, with its peak per capita personal income at about 2000.

#Plot X2
hist(expenditure$X2, main="Number of Residents per Thousand Under 18 Years", xlab="X2", ylab="Frequency")
#X2 has the highest frequency at about 400, with a largely right-skewed distribution. Thus, there is a higher frequency of residents per thousand under 18 between the values of 300 and 400.

#Plot X3
hist(expenditure$X3, main="Number of People per Thousand Living in Urban Areas", xlab="X3", ylab="Frequency")
#X3 has the highest frequency at its mean, which is around 600. It is slightly skewed right, less significantly than X2.

#Plot the relationship between Y and Region. On average, which region has the highest per capita expenditure on public education?
boxplot(Y~Region, data=expenditure, main="Region and Per Capita Public Education Expenditure", xlab="Region", ylab="Expenditure")
#Region 4 has, on average, the highest per capita expenditure on public education.

#Plot the relationship between Y and X1, describe the graph and relationship.
plot(expenditure$Y, expenditure$X1, main = "Public Education Expenditure & Personal Income Per Capita", xlab="Y", ylab="X1")
#There is a positive association between Public Education Expenditure and Personal income per capita; as income increases, so too does spend on public education.

#Reproduce the above graph adding region and display different regions with different colors/symbols.
plot(expenditure$Y, expenditure$X1, col=as.integer(expenditure$Region), pch=as.integer(expenditure$Region), main = "Public Education Expenditure & Personal Income Per Capita by Region", xlab="Y", ylab="X1")
