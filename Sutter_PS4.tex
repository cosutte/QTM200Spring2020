\section*{Question 1 (50 points): Economics}
\vspace{.25cm}
\noindent 	
In this question, use the \texttt{prestige} dataset in the \texttt{car} library. First, run the following commands:

\begin{verbatim}
install.packages(car)
library(car)
data(Prestige)
help(Prestige)
\end{verbatim} 

\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=46, lastline=49]{PS4_Sutter.R}  

\noindent We would like to study whether individuals with higher levels of income have more prestigious jobs. Moreover, we would like to study whether professionals have more prestigious jobs than blue and white collar workers.
\vspace{.5cm}
\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item [(a)]
	Create a new variable \texttt{professional} by recoding the variable \texttt{type} so that professionals are coded as $1$, and blue and white collar workers are coded as $0$ (Hint: \texttt{ifelse}.)
	
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=60, lastline=62]{PS4_Sutter.R}  
	
	\vspace{.5cm}
	
	
	\item [(b)]
	Run a linear model with \text{prestige} as an outcome and \texttt{income}, \texttt{professional}, and the interaction of the two as predictors (Note: this is a continuous $\times$ dummy interaction.)
	
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=68, lastline=73]{PS4_Sutter.R}  
	
	\vspace{.5cm}
	\item [(c)]
	
	Write the prediction equation based on the result.
	
	\vspace{.1cm}
	prestige = 21.14 + 0.0032 * income + 37.78 * professional - 0.0023 * income * professional
	
	\vspace{.1cm}
	for blue / white collar workers, where Di = 0
	
	\vspace{.1cm}
	yi = 21.142 + 0.003X
	
	\vspace{.1cm}
	for professionals, where Di = 1
	
	\vspace{.1cm}
	yi = (21.142 + 37.781) + (0.003 - 0.002)X
	
	
\vspace{.5cm}
	\item [(d)]
	Interpret the coefficient for \texttt{income}.
	\vspace{.1cm}
	Conditional on professional and the interaction between income and professional, a one unit increase in income will result in a 0.003 unit increase in the prestige score for occupation.
	
	\vspace{.5cm}	
	\item [(e)]
	Interpret the coefficient for \texttt{professional}.
	\vspace{.1cm}
	Conditional on income and the interaction between income and professional, those who receive no income have 37.78 units of prestige score more than blue or white collar individuals. 

	\vspace{.5cm}
	\item [(f)]
	What is the effect of a \$1,000 increase in income on prestige score for professional occupations? In other words, we are interested in the marginal effect of income when the variable \texttt{professional} takes the value of $1$. Calculate the change in $\hat{y}$ associated with a \$1,000 increase in income based on your answer for (c).
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=91, lastline=92]{PS4_Sutter.R}  
	
	\vspace{.5cm}
	
	
	\item [(g)]
	What is the effect of changing one's occupations from non-professional to professional when her income is \$6,000? We are interested in the marginal effect of professional jobs when the variable \texttt{income} takes the value of $6,000$. Calculate the change in $\hat{y}$ based on your answer for (c).

\section*{Question 2 (50 points): Political Science}
\vspace{.25cm}
\noindent 	Researchers are interested in learning the effect of all of those yard signs on voting preferences.\footnote{Donald P. Green, Jonathan	S. Krasno, Alexander Coppock, Benjamin D. Farrer,	Brandon Lenoir, Joshua N. Zingher. 2016. ``The effects of lawn signs on vote outcomes: Results from four randomized field experiments.'' Electoral Studies 41: 143-150. } Working with a campaign in Fairfax County, Virginia, 131 precincts were randomly divided into a treatment and control group. In 30 precincts, signs were posted around the precinct that read, ``For Sale: Terry McAuliffe. Don't Sellout Virgina on November 5.'' \\

Below is the result of a regression with two variables and a constant.  The dependent variable is the proportion of the vote that went to McAuliff's opponent Ken Cuccinelli. The first variable indicates whether a precinct was randomly assigned to have the sign against McAuliffe posted. The second variable indicates
a precinct that was adjacent to a precinct in the treatment group (since people in those precincts might be exposed to the signs).  \\

\begin{table}[!htbp]
	\centering 
	\textbf{Impact of lawn signs on vote share}\\
	\begin{tabular}{@{\extracolsep{5pt}}lccc} 
		\\[-1.8ex] 
		\hline \\[-1.8ex]
		Precinct assigned lawn signs  (n=30)  & 0.042\\
		& (0.016) \\
		Precinct adjacent to lawn signs (n=76) & 0.042 \\
		&  (0.013) \\
		Constant  & 0.302\\
		& (0.011)
		\\
		\hline \\
	\end{tabular}\\
	\footnotesize{\textit{Notes:} $R^2$=0.094, N=131}
\end{table}

\vspace{.5cm}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(a)] Use the results to determine whether having these yard signs in a precinct affects vote share (e.g., conduct a hypothesis test with $\alpha = .05$).
	
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=110, lastline=116]{PS4_Sutter.R}  
	We reject the null hypothesis, so having these yard signs in a precinct does affect vote share.
		
	\newpage
	\item [(b)]  Use the results to determine whether being next to precincts with these yard signs affects vote share (e.g., conduct a hypothesis test with $\alpha = .05$).
	
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=121, lastline=127]{PS4_Sutter.R}  
	We reject the null hypothesis, so being next to precincts with these yard signs does affect vote share.
	
	\vspace{.5cm}
	\item [(c)] Interpret the coefficient for the constant term substantively.
	
	\vspace{.1cm}
	The intercept for the constant estimates the dependent variable when precinct assigned law signs and precinct adjacent to lawn signs are set to 0, 
meaning, when precincts are neither assigned lawn signs nor adjacent to lawn signs, the impact of lawn signs on vote share will be 30.2 \% in favor of the other candidate.
	
	\item [(d)] Evaluate the model fit for this regression.  What does this	tell us about the importance of yard signs versus other factors that are not modeled?
	
	\vspace{.1cm}
	9.4\% of the model's variation can be explained by assigned/adjacent lawn signs. Thus, yard signs are not very important extremely important in this models.There must be other factors not modeled that account for the other 90.6\% of variation. 

	
\end{enumerate}
